## ✨ Project Vision
The Lunaverse is a "Magic Window" designed specifically for my granddaughters, **Luna and Stella**. Because their screen time is limited, this interactive experience is engineered to provide a high-quality, 2-minute burst of play and connection.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow
This project utilizes a "Script-First" approach combined with AI-assisted generation and manual coding:

* **Visuals:** Custom sprites of bunnies, unicorns, and family members generated via the "Nano Banana" model and clipped from original videos.
* **Audio:** Custom-ripped MP3s featuring original music and personalized voice clips (e.g., "Luna-moon-Stella-star.mp3").
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript manages audio state (preventing overlapping sounds), coordinate-based "Moon Zones," and a hard 120-second session timer.

## 🧠 Cognitive Engagement
Building this repository is part of a proactive strategy to remain active and engaged following a diagnosis of rapidly progressing early-onset Alzheimer’s. 

Every logic gate, asset path, and CSS animation reinforces:
1. **Executive Function:** Planning the 2-minute session flow.
2. **Associative Memory:** Mapping specific sounds to specific family sprites.
3. **Technical Persistence:** Managing a growing empire of 27 repositories on a mobile device.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Open:** Access the URL on a mobile device.
2. **Interact:** Tap anywhere to see sparkles and a random family surprise.
3. **Secret Moon:** Tapping the Moon (top-left) triggers a guaranteed **Luna Unicorn**.
4. **Conclusion:** After 2 minutes, the "Goodnight Adventure" song plays, and the screen fades to rest.

*Created with love for Luna and Stella. Keep dreaming.*
